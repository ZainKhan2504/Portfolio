        <p>
          I'm a front-end engineer and a thesis student of MS Computer Science at Linköping University. I enjoy
          designing and implementing personalized software solutions for people and have therefore worked on projects
          like photo sharing platforms with authorized access, a registration portal for drivers, generalized EMS, and a
          human resource management system. I have 2+ years of hands-on experience in effectively translating design to
          front-end code, estimating time, determining developer requirements and specifications, and collaborating with
          creative and development teams for the successful execution of ideas and projects. I'd love to combine my
          passion for designing solutions with my front-end development skills to continue building personalized
          software solutions for people.
